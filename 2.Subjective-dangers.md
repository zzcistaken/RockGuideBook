Subjective Dangers
----
The leading cause of accidents in the mountains is human error. Accidents are often the result of climbers' overconfidence, ignorance or overstraining. If you do not recognize the dangers or you face them without suitable equipment and tactics, you and your rope partner could end up in a dangerous situation. Self-relection, caution and a certain respect as well as solid training are all prerequisites for safe mountaineering.

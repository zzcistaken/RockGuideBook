Subjective Dangers
----
The leading cause of accidents in the mountains is human error. Accidents are often the result of climbers' overconfidence, ignorance or overstraining. If you do not recognize the dangers or you face them without suitable equipment and tactics, you and your rope partner could end up in a dangerous situation. Self-relection, caution and a certain respect as well as solid training are all prerequisites for safe mountaineering.

subjective: 英 [səb'dʒektɪv] 美 [səb'dʒɛktɪv] adj. 主观的；个人的；自觉的

overstraining: 过度训练过度紧张

tactics: 英 ['tæktɪks] 美 ['tæktɪks] n. 策略；战术；用兵学

OVERESTIMATING YOUR OWN ABILITIES
--
An incorrect self-assessment and a lack of knowledge about the tour are the most frequent causes of accidents.

overestimate: vt. 对……评价过高；对……估计过高

self-assessment: ['selfə'sesmənt] n. 自我评估


MISJUDGMENT OF THE SITUATION
--
Good, experienced mountaineers recognize misjudgments early on and have a plan B up their sleeves.

early on: 在早期；从事，经营；继续下去


FEAR AND PANIC SITUATIONS
--
Fear in itself is not bad. On the contrary, it warns us and has an evolutionary purpose to protect us from dangers. The goal is therefore not to be fearless but to deal with fear and thus to recognize your own limits.

evolutionary: 英 [,iːvə'luːʃənərɪ] 美 [,ivə'luʃənɛri] adj. 进化的；发展的；渐进的

ALPINE TERRAIN
--
Compared to sport cimbing, additional factors come into play in alpine climbing: Seriousness (safeguards), poor orientation and the length of the tour can push climbers to their limits both psychologically and physically.

terrain: 英 [təˈreɪn] 美 [tɛˈren] n. [地理] 地形，地势；领域；地带

Seriousness: n. 严重性；严肃；认真

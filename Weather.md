WEATHER

The weather is an extremely important factor on every mountain and climbing tour, especially when it comes to safety. 
This is why the WEATHER FORECAST plays a key role, even as early as during tour planning. But your own WEATHER OBSERVATIONS 
are also crucial in order to detect thunderstorms in time and to make apppropriate decisions at an early stage.

THUNDERSTORMS
    1. Early start, early return if there is a risk of thunderstorms.
    2. Thunderstorms can also occur in stable high pressure conditions.
    3. Observe cloud formation: Cumulus-->Castellanus-->Cumulonimbus (anvil shape).
    4. Sharp cloud edges and strong swelling (Castellanus) indicate a high risk of thunderstorms.
    5. Decide to retreat or abort the tour in good time.
